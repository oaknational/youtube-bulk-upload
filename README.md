# YouTube Bulk Upload

This is a tool to upload multiple videos to YouTube at once.

The details for each video are held in a Google Sheet. The script will read the sheet and transfer the videos from Google Drive to YouTube.

There are two versions of the script:

1. A [TypeScript version](./typescript/index.ts)
2. A [Python version](./python/main.py)
