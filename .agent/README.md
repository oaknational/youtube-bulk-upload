## 🤖 For AI Agents

When working with this codebase:

1. **Start with project-summary.md** to understand the overall architecture
2. **Review CLAUDE.md** in the root for development guidelines
3. **Check implementation status** to see what's completed
4. **Follow the established patterns** - both implementations use identical architecture

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Both TypeScript and Python implementations follow:

- **7 Services Pattern**: Each service has a single responsibility
- **Dependency Injection**: All I/O operations are injected
- **Pure Functions**: Business logic separated from side effects
- **Protocol/Interface First**: Define contracts before implementation

## 📊 Current Status

- **TypeScript**: ✅ Complete with 100% test coverage
- **Python**: ✅ Complete with 88% test coverage (236 tests)
- **Documentation**: 🚧 High-level docs complete, inline docs in progress

## 🔑 Key Files

For understanding the codebase flow:

- Entry points: `typescript/src/main.ts`, `python/src/main.py`
- Orchestration: `VideoProcessor` classes
- Dependency setup: `DependencyContainer` classes
- Type definitions: `types/index.ts`, `models/__init__.py`
